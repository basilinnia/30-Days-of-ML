The adjective \"deep\" in deep learning refers to the use of multiple layers in the network. Methods used can be either supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.\n",

    "$b$ would be a base price, accounting for factors like location, amenities, etc., that contribute to the overall house price.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "During training, the neural network adjusts the weights ($w$) and bias ($b$) to minimize the difference between predicted prices and actual prices in the training data. Once trained, the neural network can make predictions for house prices based on new square footage inputs."
